This is a simple text file. Lets see if we can transmit that without file corruption. Data corruption can severely disrupt business processes. In the worst case, it isn’t noticed for a long time, and a broken file is copied to multiple locations. By the time anyone realizes there is a problem, recovering the lost data may be difficult or impossible. Adhering to data management best practices should minimize the chances of undetected data corruption and provide a way to restore data integrity. 

File types used by only one application, such as proprietary software, are the hardest to recover from corruption. The software sometimes isn’t robust, writing bad files if they get too big or aren’t edited in just the right way. Compatibility issues can also occur from one version of the application to the next and many times, third-party tools are not able to recover these uncommon file formats.

Sometimes this results in the appearance of a broken file when it’s actually intact. If the application that opens a file is an older version of the one that created it, it may display alarming error messages that don’t explain the real problem. In these cases, opening the file with the latest version should fix the problem. Make sure not to save the file with the old software, or the damage could become permanent.
